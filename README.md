# DIGI405 Assignments

This is a repository for DIGI405 assignment notebooks. 

## Instructions to DIGI405 students

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/polsci/DIGI405-assignments/releases/latest) of this repository to get the latest version released to the class. Required libraries to run the notebook are installed on the class JupyterHub. If you have issues, please use the course forum or email teaching staff for fastest support.  

## Instructions to DIGI405 teaching team about releases

Use the CHANGELOG to note all changes in detail.  

Individual notebooks must include the version number in the first markdown cell.  

* Use 0.x.0 for the first version released to the class.  
* If there are updates required to the initially released notebook/s, increment the version as 0.x.y, where y is the update number. Link this to the CHANGELOG as indicated in the example below.   
* Annotate any changes throughout the notebook after initial release so the students can clearly see any changes made. 
* For the next new semester, minor release comments in the markdown cell can be removed after incrementing to the next 0.x.0 version. 
* If there are no new releases in a semester, then the version does not need to change.
