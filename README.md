# DIGI405 Assignments

This is a repository for DIGI405 assignment notebooks. 

## Instructions for releases

Individual assignments should include a version number in the first markdown cell. Use 0.x.0 for the first version released to the class. If there are updates required to this increment the version as 0.x.y, where y is the update number. Annotate any changes after initial release so the students can clearly see any changes made to the live assignment notebook. For the next new semester, minor release comments can be removed after incrementing to the next 0.x.0 version. If the notebook does not need changes between semesters, then the version does not need to change. 

### Format in first notebook cell for first release for semester

    Version 0.2.0 

### Format in first notebook cell if changes required after release

    Version 0.2.1 - 2025-08-19 - change to enforce filtering of the preview texts based on selected labels, ensuring grid search commented out by default.   
    Note: changes for 0.2.1 are annotated with comments in the code in case you want to apply these directly to your own notebook. Search for 0.2.1 to find these changes.

### Format for inline comments in notebook

    # Note: Version 0.2.1 corrects display of the dataframe to ensure filtering by the selected labels
